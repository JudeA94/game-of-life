# John Conway's Game of Life
This is a React implementation of John Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton simulation that models the behavior of populations 

## About
I built this app in my free time during my bootcamp at MakersAcademy

## How to use
Make sure Node.js and npm are installed  
Clone or download the repository  
Run npm install to install the dependencies. 
Run npm start to start the development server  
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app  
Or the app is hosted [here](https://game-of-life1.herokuapp.com/)  

## Rules
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation   
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation   
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation   
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction   

## Features
Start, pause, and clear the simulation  
Adjust the speed of the simulation    
Click on cells to toggle their state (alive or dead)  
Randomize the initial state of the cells    
Adjust the size of the game board  
Choose which version of the game to play  

## Technologies
This project is built using:  
React  
Node.js  
Jest  

## Improvements
The styling of the app could be improved  
The app is currently not mobile friendly
